# Random-Anime-Generator

<p>This project started as a fun way for me to pick what anime to watch next. It was my very first project I created at Code First Girls, where I got to play around with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I built it on CodePen, which made it a hands-on learning experience. It's a lighthearted project that combines my love for anime with my coding journey, showcasing my early steps into the world of web development. </p>
